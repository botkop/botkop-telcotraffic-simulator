Telco Traffic Generator
=======================

Just brainstorming for now ...

The application allows to generate fake mobile telco traffic.

It is built with Scala and Akka actors, so can be deployed distributed over as many nodes as you like.

Vocabulary:
- 'trip' is a combination of a 'subscriber', a 'route', and a 'velocity'
- 'route' is a route calculated by Google, between 2 random points within the area defined by 'mcc' and 'mnc'
- 'subscriber' is a random record taken from the traffic database table 'identities'
- 'mcc' is the mobile country code
- 'mnc' is the mobile network code
- 'slide' is the size of the sliding publishing window, in Milliseconds
- 'velocity' is the speed at which the subscribers travel, in Kilometers per hour
- 'traffic database' is an sqlite database residing in folder data/. It contains celltower information obtained from http://opencellid.org/#action=database.downloadDatabase. To generate this database, see: TODO


To start the application, execute
./activator run
in the root of the checked out code.

The simulation can be invoked either manually from the web interface or through REST.
To use the HTML interface, point your browser to http://localhost:9000/simulator

To use the REST interface, see the scripts in folder bin/

Input parameters to the application are:
- mcc, Integer
- mnc, Integer
- slide, Double
- velocity, Double
- number of trips, Integer


TODO:
Traffic is currently logged to stdout only.
This will be made configurable, so that you can send traffic information to Kafka, or to a socket for example

Describe how to generate the traffic database

Traffic generated by the celltowers will be made configurable through templates
